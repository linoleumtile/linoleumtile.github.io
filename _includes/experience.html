		<h3 class="sub-small">February 2014 &mdash; June 2014</h5>
		<p>My primary role was to provide for UX needs on the mobile web team at Target. Embedded within a product team, I would research and propose potential enhancements to the mobile site, execute wireframes and usability tests, and collaborate with visual designers, product managers and business analysts.</p>

		<h3>UX Designer<span class="contract">CONTRACT</span></h3>
		<h3 class="sub">HealthPartners</h4>
		<h3 class="sub-small">October 2011 &mdash; February 2014</h5>
		<p>I worked within insurance, care and wellbeing projects to provide great user-centered design.</p>
		<p>I functioned primarily as a generalist, doing everything from research to usability testing to interaction and experience design.</p>
		<p>As more and more projects worked towards adopting agile, I worked to integrate lean UX methods like project team design sessions and guerilla testing into projects.</p>
		<p class=note>In the interest of transparency, it's important to note that I began my tenure at HealthPartners as an intern, and was promoted to Associate in 2012 and promoted again in 2013 to the title listed above.</p>
